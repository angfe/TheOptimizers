# Analytics and Application Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the team assignment for the Analytics and Application course at the Univsersity of Cologne.
The assignment is to test representative cross-section of the data analytics and machine learning approaches covered during the course. It is based on a real-world problem with high relevance to the current hot topic of electric vehicles and will act as an illustration of how we can use data in impactful ways to address societal issues and business at the same time.
